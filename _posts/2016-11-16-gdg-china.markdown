## Testing With Angular2

In a recent trip to Shanghai for work I was lucky enough to have a chance to speak at the Google Developer Launchpad.
The talk was on testing in Angular2.  It was interesting because while I thought I was prepared I was not prepared for one thing, language barrier.

My initial thoughts were that I was going to be able to do my talk in English but luckily for me the group was mixed, English speakers and non-English speakers.
Notice how I used the word luckily?  It really was a great opportunity for me to grow as a speaker.  Getting the chance to work with a translator during my talk
was amazing!  It stretched me and forced me to slow down.  What a great opportunity!

Here are the [slides from the talk][slides].
